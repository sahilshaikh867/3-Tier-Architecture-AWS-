## 📌 3-Tier Architecture on AWS with Load Balancer & Auto Scaling

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **highly available, scalable, and secure 3-tier web architecture on AWS** using core AWS services. The architecture follows industry best practices by separating the application into **Web, Application, and Database tiers**, each deployed in isolated subnets within a custom VPC.

### 🔧 Architecture Overview

* **Web Tier**
  Deployed on EC2 instances running **Nginx**, placed behind an **internet-facing Application Load Balancer** to handle incoming client traffic.

* **Application Tier**
  Runs **PHP-based application logic** on EC2 instances, fronted by an **internal Application Load Balancer** to ensure secure internal communication.

* **Database Tier**
  Uses **Amazon RDS (MySQL)** deployed in private subnets, accessible only from the application tier for enhanced security.

### ⚙️ Key AWS Services Used

* Amazon VPC (Custom networking with public & private subnets)
* EC2 (Web & App servers)
* Application Load Balancer (Public & Internal)
* Auto Scaling Groups
* Amazon RDS (MySQL)
* Security Groups & Route Tables
* Amazon Machine Images (AMI)

### 🚀 Features

* High availability across multiple Availability Zones
* Auto scaling for Web and Application tiers
* Secure network isolation using private subnets
* Layered security with tier-specific security groups
* Fault tolerance with health checks and load balancing

### 🎯 Purpose

This project is built to:

* Understand real-world AWS architecture patterns
* Practice deploying scalable and secure cloud infrastructure
* Serve as a reference for interviews and production-ready designs
